Not even that one location you think is pretty neat is that good. In fact, it's peanuts to Location 2.</p>

                    <p>You don't want to be one of those people who were never truly alive, do you. Of course not. You're a serious, living man, and you have to prove your seriousness by going here. Right now.</p>

                    <p>I wish I could change that, but I can't. I feel so pathetic and ugly laying here, waiting for you. Every day I stare up at the cracks in the ceiling and all I can think about is how unfair it all is...</p>
                    <p>The doctor came today. He told me I could go home for a short stay. It’s not that I'm getting better. It’s just that this may be my last chance...I think you know what I mean. Even so, I'm glad to be coming home. I've missed you terribly. But I'm afraid, James. I'm afraid you don't really want me to come home.</p>
