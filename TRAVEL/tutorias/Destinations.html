        <!-- we're going to create a bunch of anchors that are various types of destinations or locations, so that we can have links that don't just take you to the top of the destination page, but to the specific anchor  -->
        
        <a name="anchor1">
            <h1>Location 1</h1>
            <p>This is the nature of location one. There are many places one could go, but the place we have decided to go is Location 1.</p>
            <p>Isn't it wonderful that we have the opportunty to go to Location1? We are all thankful that this is even an option in our sad, sad, deprived lives. Was this the work of God, or the Fatherly Leader? Impossible to say, but regardless, thank you, thank you, thank you.</p>
        </a>
        
        <a name="anchor2">
            <h1>Location 2</h1>
            <p>Location 2 is a marvel to behold. You might think you've seen some nice things in your life, but boy, let me tell you, if you haven't been to Location 2 you are seriously missing out. Not even that one location you think is pretty neat is that good. In fact, it's peanuts to Location 2.</p>
            <p>People are saying Location 2 is the place to be. More and more people are saying it. It's good, folks.</p>
            <p>Location 2 is good.</p>
        </a>
        
        <a name="anchor3">
            <h1>Location 3</h1>
            <p>If you die before visiting Location 3, were you ever truly alive? Scientists have proven, with science, that the answer is no.</p>
            <p>There was a study and everything. I was there, I saw the beakers and the bubbling colored water in the Erlenmeyer flasks. It was the most scientific study in science history. And that's saying something, because science history is damn scientific.</p>
            <p>You don't want to be one of those people who were never truly alive, do you. Of course not. You're a serious, living man, and you have to prove your seriousness by going here. Right now.</p>
        </a>
        
        <a name="anchor4">
            <h1>Location 4</h1>
            <p>You've been here before, haven't you?</p>
            <p>In childhood dreams you walked in this place. It calls to you now, exending its oneirc tendrils into your mind from that place we all go when we close our eyes and think on things long lost to the mists of time. A sanctum of forgotten memories, a lighthouse calling you home.</p>
            <p>Why are you hesitating?</p>
            <p>Look, the ground is crumbling beneath your feet. There is only one hope for you - jump!</p>
        </a>
        
        <a name="anchor5">
            <h1>Location 5</h1>
            <p>I mean, why not.</p>
            <p>What else are you doing with your life?</p>
        </a>
        
        <a name="anchor6">
            <h1>Location 6</h1>
            <p>In my restless dreams, I see that town.</p>
            <p>You promised me you'd take me there again someday, but you never did. Well, I'm alone there now...in our 'special place'...waiting for you.</p>
            <p>Waiting for you to come to see me. But you never do. And so I wait, wrapped in my cocoon of pain and loneliness. I know I've done a terrible thing to you.  Something you'll never forgive me for.</p>
            <p>I wish I could change that, but I can't. I feel so pathetic and ugly laying here, waiting for you. Every day I stare up at the cracks in the ceiling and all I can think about is how unfair it all is...</p>
            <p>The doctor came today. He told me I could go home for a short stay. It’s not that I'm getting better. It’s just that this may be my last chance...I think you know what I mean. Even so, I'm glad to be coming home. I've missed you terribly. But I'm afraid, James. I'm afraid you don't really want me to come home.</p>
